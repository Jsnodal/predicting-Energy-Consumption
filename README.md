Project Description: 
                                                                    Energy Consumption Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the total energy consumption of buildings based on various physical characteristics and operational factors. The primary objective is to develop a model that helps businesses and utilities understand their energy usage, enabling them to make informed decisions about energy efficiency and cost reduction.

Key Components:
Data Collection: The project uses a dataset that includes features such as:

Relative compactness of the building
Surface area, wall area, and roof area
Overall height and orientation of the building
Glazing area and distribution
Heating and cooling load requirements
Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes cleaning and scaling to ensure accuracy. This step is crucial for preparing the data for modeling, as it standardizes the values, making it easier for the model to learn from them.

Model Development: A machine learning model is trained using the processed data. The model analyzes the relationships between the features and the target variable—total energy consumption—to identify patterns that can predict future energy needs.

Prediction: Once the model is trained, it can predict the total energy consumption for new buildings based on their features. This capability allows businesses to estimate their energy usage and plan accordingly.

Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score to assess its accuracy and reliability.

Impact:
By providing accurate energy consumption predictions, this project aims to assist businesses in optimizing their energy usage, reducing operational costs, and promoting sustainability in energy management.
